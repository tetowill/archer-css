##Archer Title Sequence using CSS

This is my attempt to recreate the orginal Archer title sequence using CSS, a fun project I did for [Infinity Interactive](http://iinteractive.com) to demo CSS keyframe animations.

For more details, please take some time to read _[Taking CSS Animations to the Danger Zone](http://iinteractive.com/notebook/2015/04/08/taking-css-animations-to-the-danger-zone.html)_, a blog post I wrote about this project. The full animation is embedded at the end of the post.

The only JS being used in this demo is for the Play and Stop buttons, which were added to give a little more control. They simply add / remove the _start_ class, which is linked to all the animation properties.

Enjoy!
